The version 4.0.0 introduces several major changes, those are breaking changes:

## Migrated from Three.js to Babylon.js

Three.js was no powerful nor optimized enough to support the amount of elements and materials we wanted to handle. This 
migration also proves the idea behind the decoupling of the SDK, we managed to change the entire rendering engine without
affecting the user scenes.

## New material entity

Previously when you wanted to create and modify a material, you needed to specify it as a component of a entity like this:

```xml
<scene id="old_scene">
  <sphere material="map: some/url.png; alphaTest: 0.5" />
</scene>
```

That leads to material duplications and special care with garbage collection in the engine; and to a super verbosic and
not well decoupled code in the scene's code.  

We converted the material into an entity itself, now, the materials are using a PBR pipeline by default.

Here is how it looks now:

```xml
<scene id="new_scene">
  <material id="reusable_material" albedo-color="some/url.png" roughness="0.5" />
  <sphere material="#reusable_material" />
</scene>
```

## Fixed the coordinate system

Previous to this release, we had a patch for the reference system. The Z axis was inverted inside the parcel in relation
to the world-grid.  

It means if an object was standing in the world position `55,55`, it was in the parcel `5,-4`. It is now in the parcel `5,5`.

You need to be carefull with this change since it inverts an entire axis, you might have to change the position of your entities.
